# Stable Diffusion File Manager

A small script to help sort downloaded models. This script will sort files into their proper folders, based on given parameters. It them uses the same parameters to generate a json compatible with Automatic1111's Extra Networks GUI. Stores slightly more information than the json generated by Automatic1111. For people who want a bit more customization outside of downloader extensions available, or not using the webui.
